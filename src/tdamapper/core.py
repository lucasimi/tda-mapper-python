"""
Core tools for creating and analyzing Mapper graphs.

The Mapper algorithm is a method for exploring the shape and structure of
high-dimensional datasets, by constructing a graph representation called Mapper
graph. The algorithm has three main steps:

1. **Filtering**: Apply a lens function (also called filter) to map the data points
   to a lower-dimensional space, such as a scalar value or a 2D plane.

2. **Covering**: Arrange the lens space into overlapping open sets, using a
   cover algorithm such as uniform intervals or balls.

3. **Clustering**: Group the data points in each open set into clusters, using a
   clustering algorithm such as single-linkage or DBSCAN.

The Mapper graph consists of nodes that represent clusters of data
points, and edges that connect overlapping clusters (clusters obtained from
different open sets can possibly overlap). For more details on the Mapper
algorithm and its applications, see

    Gurjeet Singh, Facundo MÃ©moli and Gunnar Carlsson, "Topological Methods for
    the Analysis of High Dimensional Data Sets and 3D Object Recognition",
    Eurographics Symposium on Point-Based Graphics, 2007.

This module provides the class :class:`tdamapper.core.MapperAlgorithm`, which
encapsulates the algorithm and its parameters. The Mapper graph produced by this
module is a NetworkX graph object.

    Identify the nodes of the Mapper graph.

    The function first covers the lens space with overlapping sets, using the
    cover algorithm provided. Then, for each set, it clusters the points of the
    dataset that have lens values within that set, using the clustering
    algorithm provided. The clusters are then labeled with unique integers,
    starting from zero for each set. The function then adds an offset to the
    cluster labels, such that the labels are distinct across all sets. The
    offset is equal to the maximum label of the previous set plus one.

    The function returns a list of node labels for each point in the dataset.
    The list at position i contains the labels of the nodes that the point at
    position i belongs to. The labels are sorted in ascending order, and there
    are no duplicates. If i < j, the labels at position i are strictly less than
    those at position j.
