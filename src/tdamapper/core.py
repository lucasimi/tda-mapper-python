"""
Core tools for creating and analyzing Mapper graphs.

The Mapper algorithm is a method for exploring the shape and structure of
high-dimensional datasets, by constructing a graph representation called Mapper
graph. The algorithm has three main steps:

1. **Filtering**: Apply a lens function (also called filter) to map the data
   points to a lower-dimensional space, such as a scalar value or a 2D plane.

2. **Covering**: Arrange the lens space into overlapping open sets, using a
   cover algorithm such as uniform intervals or balls.

3. **Clustering**: Group the data points in each open set into clusters, using
   a clustering algorithm such as single-linkage or DBSCAN.

The Mapper graph consists of nodes that represent clusters of data
points, and edges that connect overlapping clusters (clusters obtained from
different open sets can possibly overlap). For more details on the Mapper
algorithm and its applications, see

    Gurjeet Singh, Facundo MÃ©moli and Gunnar Carlsson, "Topological Methods for
    the Analysis of High Dimensional Data Sets and 3D Object Recognition",
    Eurographics Symposium on Point-Based Graphics, 2007.

This module provides the class :class:`tdamapper.core.MapperAlgorithm`, which
encapsulates the algorithm and its parameters. The Mapper graph produced by
this module is a NetworkX graph object.
