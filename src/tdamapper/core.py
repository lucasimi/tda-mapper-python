"""This module implements the main tools for creating and analyzing Mapper graphs.

The Mapper graph is a simplified representation of the shape and structure of the data,
composed of nodes and edges. Each node corresponds to a cluster of points having similar
values in the lens space. Each edge connects two nodes that share some points in their
corresponding clusters.

The Mapper algorithm consists of three main steps: filtering, covering, and clustering.
First, the data points are mapped to a lower-dimensional space using a lens function.
Then, the lens space is covered by overlapping open sets, using an open cover algorithm.
Finally, the data points in each open set are clustered using a clustering algorithm,
and the clusters are connected by edges if they share points in the overlap.

The module provides a class that encapsulates the algorithm and its parameters,
and a fit_transform method that takes a dataset and returns a NetworkX graph object.
For more details on the Mapper algorithm and its applications, see
