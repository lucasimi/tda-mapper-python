Utilities for computing metrics.

This module provides functions to calculate various distance metrics. A metric,
or distance function, is a function that maps two points to a double value,
representing the "distance" between them. For a function to qualify as a valid
metric, it must satisfy the following properties:

1. Symmetry: The distance between two points is the same regardless of the
    order, i.e.:
    :math:`d(x, y) = d(y, x)` for all x and y.
2. Positivity: The distance between two distinct points is always positive,
    i.e.:
    :math:`d(x, y) > 0` for all distinct x and y, and :math:`d(x, x) = 0`
    for every x.
3. Triangle inequality: The distance between two points is less than or equal
    to the sum of the distances from a third point, i.e.:
    :math:`d(x, z) \\leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)` for all points x, y, z.

Supported distance metrics include:
- Euclidean: The square root of the sum of squared differences between the
components of vectors.
- Minkowski: A generalization of the Euclidean and Chebyshev distances,
parameterized by an order `p`.
- Chebyshev: The maximum absolute difference between the components of vectors.
- Cosine: A distance on unit vectors based on cosine similarity.
