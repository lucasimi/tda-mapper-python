The Mapper algorithm is a well-known technique in the field of topological
data analysis that allows data to be represented as a graph.
Mapper is used in various fields such as machine learning, data mining, and
social sciences, due to its ability to preserve topological features of the
underlying space, providing a visual representation that facilitates
exploration and interpretation. For an in-depth coverage of Mapper you can
