Overview
========

**tda-mapper** is a simple and efficient implementation of Mapper algorithm for
Topological Data Analysis.

-  **Installation**: ``pip install tda-mapper``

-  **Documentation**: https://tda-mapper.readthedocs.io/en/main/

The Mapper algorithm is a well-known technique in the field of
topological data analysis that allows data to be represented as a graph.
Mapper is used in various fields such as machine learning, data mining,
and social sciences, due to its ability to preserve topological features
of the underlying space, providing a visual representation that
facilitates exploration and interpretation. For an in-depth coverage of
Mapper you can read `the original
paper <https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf>`__.
